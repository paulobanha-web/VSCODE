TimeGAN for Longitudinal Tabular Data
Validating Synthetic Data Utility in Multi-Class Health Prediction
This repository contains the source code and experimental framework for the Master's Dissertation: "Time-series GAN for Longitudinal Tabular Data: Validating Synthetic Data Utility in Multi-Class Health Prediction."

📌 Overview
This project addresses the challenge of data scarcity and class imbalance in longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR). Using a dataset of only 117 records, we implemented a Time-series Generative Adversarial Network (TimeGAN) to create a high-fidelity synthetic patient population (N=15,904).

The core of this research is the validation of an architectural dependency: proving that sequence-aware models (LSTM) are required to fully leverage the temporal fidelity preserved by TimeGAN, whereas static models (MLP) fail to generalize.

🚀 Key Features
TimeGAN Implementation: Optimized for longitudinal tabular data using GRU cells.

PCA Dimensionality Reduction: Pre-processing pipeline reducing 55 clinical features to 39 components.

Rejection Sampling: Custom logic to mitigate extreme class imbalance in synthetic generation.

TSTR Framework: A rigorous "Train Synthetic, Test Real" evaluation pipeline.

Comparative Modeling: Implementation of MLP (Static) vs. LSTM (Sequential) classifiers.
